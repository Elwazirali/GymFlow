# GymFlow

A social network for meat-heads [Markdown][1] and athletes.

*Note: Currently in development.*

## Capabilities

Users are able to post questions, answer questions, and comment on posts related to athleticism and #gymLife

### We are currently working on the following features

1. Allow users to post information indicating their progress
2. Integrating wearable technologies to gather work out data and post on user's profile 
3. Chat capabilities for gym-specific usage to allow people that go to the same gym to interact and introduce each other or plan events (like an iron marathon)
4. Ummm... Probably more stuff coming soon.

*Note: App is currently up and running. User sign up and some functionality has been implemented. Feel free to create an account and check out the app. [Roman numeral four][2].*
